Computers do not inherently know human representations of time; as such, they store time as a large binary number, indicating a number of time units after a set date and time. This is much easier for a computer to keep track of. In the case of Unix time, the time unit is seconds, and the set date and time is the epoch. Therefore, Unix time is the number of seconds since the epoch. The epoch is defined as January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC. This is quite confusing for humans, but again, computers store time in a way that makes sense for them. It is represented “under the hood” as a floating point number which is how computers represent real (ℝ) numbers."

    "Time zones can be a source of confusion and frustration in geoscientific data and in computer programming in general. Core date and time libraries in various programming languages, including Python, inevitably have design flaws, relating to time zones, date and time formatting, and other inherently complex issues. Third-party libraries are often created to fix the limitations of the core libraries, but this approach is frequently unsuccessful. To avoid time-zone-related issues, it is best to handle data in UTC; if data cannot be handled in UTC, efforts should be made to consistently use the same time zone for all data. However, this is not always possible; events such as severe weather are expected to be reported in a local time zone, which is not always consistent.\n",

    "The Python Standard Library contains several modules for dealing with date and time data. We saw how we can avoid some name ambiguities by aliasing the module names; this can be done with import statements like <span style='color:red'>import</span> datetime as dt and <span style='color:red'>import</span> time as tm. The tm.time()</span> method just returns the current Unix time in seconds – which can be useful for measuring elapsed time, but not all that useful for working with geophysical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span style='color:red'>datetime</span> module contains various classes for storing, converting, comparing, and formatting date and time data on the Gregorian calendar. We saw how we can parse data files with date and time strings into <span style='color:red'>dt.datetime</span> objects using the <span style='color:red'>dt.datetime.strptime()</span> method. We also saw how to perform arithmetic using date and time data; this uses the <span style='color:red'>dt.timedelta</span> class to represent intervals of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we looked at using the third-party pytz module to handle time zone awareness and conversions."
